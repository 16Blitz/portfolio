        <p class="para">My hobby is reading interesting, Inspirational success stories, and knowledgeable books in my free time which will help me to stay motivated and disciplined. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home work. I am 14 years old and read in class 8th standard. Now I know very well that reading is very good habit which can make me a complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone and I also like painting as my other hobby. Reading books keep one always happy and busy, Making new paintings unleashes creativity and the curiosity to do something better... Reading is a good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life while making paintings can improve your concentration, develop your critical thinking skills, and enhance your fine motor skills.
